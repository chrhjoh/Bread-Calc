## Bread Calculator

This is the repository for my small bread-calculator app. This app takes care of the calculation hassle when incorporating flour and water in multiple ways (i.e. poolish, levain and bulk fermentation), while keeping the hydration level to the specified amount.

Currently hosted by shinyapps.io at: <https://christianjohansen.shinyapps.io/bread-calculator/>.

The app creates a customisable recipe and works with both levain, poolish and fresh yeast.

There's also options for specifying other ingredients such as oil, eggs, sugar, etc.
